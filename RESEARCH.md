## Custom Kali Linux System with Local AI Server Integration

### 1. System Overview and Hardware Validation

Research indicates that Kali Linux supports the Intel Core i5-4590 CPU and integrated Intel HD Graphics 4600. Ensure BIOS is set for UEFI with Secure Boot disabled. Latest kernels (6.x) provide good hardware compatibility including Realtek network controllers. Use non-free firmware packages for Realtek Wi-Fi if needed.

### 2. Partition Layout and Storage Configuration
- **Root**: 500GB, ext4 or btrfs; ext4 tends to be stable for Kali.
- **Swap**: 32GB; zram can supplement RAM.
- **Persistent storage**: 500GB for datasets and models, consider btrfs with compression.
- **EFI system partition**: 512MB, FAT32.
- USB drives can be formatted as ext4 and mounted for extra model storage.

### 3. System and AI Model Setup
Install Kali Linux (latest). Include default penetration testing tools. Set up Python environment with `virtualenv` for AI frameworks:
- `langchain`, `autogen`, `metagpt`, `crewai`. Ensure dependencies installed via `pip`.
- For local models like Llama, Mistral, and Phi-3, use frameworks such as `llama-cpp-python` or `transformers` with `bitsandbytes` for quantized models. GPU acceleration via Intelâ€™s iGPU is limited; rely on CPU execution or consider external GPU.

### 4. Dual-Boot Setup
During installation, create partitions as above. Windows 10 partition remains intact. Install GRUB to EFI partition, verifying entries for both Kali and Windows.

### 5. AI Server and Agent Integration
Set up an API server (e.g., FastAPI) to expose AI model endpoints. Agents in LangChain/AutoGen can call these endpoints for local inference. Models downloaded to persistent storage allow offline use.

### 6. File Server, Web Server, and Database Setup
- **File sharing**: configure Samba for cross-platform access or NFS for Linux clients.
- **Web server**: use Nginx or Apache to host API and optionally a simple dashboard.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL works well for logging tasks and results.

### 7. Snapshot, Backup, and Offloading
Use tools like Timeshift or Snapper for snapshots of the root filesystem. rsync or BorgBackup can handle external backups to USB drives.

### 8. Network Configuration and VPN Setup
Disable Wi-Fi via NetworkManager if Ethernet only is desired. Configure WireGuard for secure remote access.

### 9. Testing and Validation
After installation, verify dual-boot works, AI models load and run, and backup/restore functions correctly.

### 10. Continuous Improvement
Regularly update Kali and AI frameworks. Monitor model performance and expand storage as needed.
